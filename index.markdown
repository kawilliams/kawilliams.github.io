I am interested in how we think about data and communicate those ideas. I also design data visualizations for high-performance computing data.

I'm the head of the [Davidson Data Vis Lab](https://davidson-data-vis-lab.github.io/). 

Below is a brief overview of my research, teaching, and other projects. More information can be found on the individual pages.

# [Research](./research/index.md)

My most recent publication was [Data Abstraction Elephants: The Initial Diversity of Data Representations and Mental Models](./_research_pages/1elephants.md) with Alex Bigelow and Kate Isaacs. This work was presented and published as part of ACM CHI23. More information can be found under [Research](./research/index.md).

# [Teaching](./teaching/index.markdown)

For Fall 2024, I am teaching:
* CSC 121 B: Programming and Problem Solving (MWF 9:30-10:20)
* [CSC 363: Human Computer Interaction (HCI)](./teaching/hci/) (MW 2:30-3:45)
