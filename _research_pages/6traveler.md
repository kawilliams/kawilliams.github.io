#### Traveler Integrated is an integrated visualization system for connecting OTF2 stack traces and aggregate expression trees. It combines complex visualizations, like Atria and [Ravel](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/people/kisaacs/), while providing lower-level context, like linking to the source code performance metrics.

I contributed the code for Atria, a tree visualization. The full Traveler Integrated tool relies on several tools and the work of several other collaborators.
