<ul>
  <li>Group size: <strong>Individual</strong></li>
  <li>Assignment opens: Wednesday, September 10</li>
  <li>Due: Wednesday, September 17 by 11:55 PM</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Before your first group design sprint, this individual assignment will introduce you to some aspects of the design process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Visual Design</li>
  <li>Sketching for Ideation (using paper)</li>
  <li>Evaluation (planning)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="choose-your-problem">Choose Your Problem</h2>
<p>This should <em>build</em> on what you discovered in your <a href="/teaching/hci/assignments/hw2">needfinding</a> exercise. Based on your empathy map from the previous assignment, you should now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://public-media.interaction-design.org/pdf/Point-Of-View.pdf">“Point of View” (POV)</a> – remember the three key statements
    <ul>
      <li>We met …&lt;the <strong>user</strong> from the empathy map&gt;</li>
      <li>We realized …&lt;the user <strong>needs</strong> XYZ&gt;</li>
      <li>It would be game-changing to …&lt;an <strong>insight</strong> from your synthesis of your data&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Brainstorm <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-might-we-questions/">“How Might We” (HMW) statements</a></li>
  <li>Narrow down to the problem you will solve…</li>
  <li>Start sketching!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="information-design">Information Design</h2>
<p><em>Collect evidence along the way! Don’t shoot yourselves in the foot for your design reflection!</em> Be sure to state your assumptions and document your process. Include ample photos and description of the current user experience. What are the potential pain points in the current experience? Who is the user that your design is intended for? How does your design improve upon that experience? This is intentionally somewhat open-ended to give you freedom to explore a problem and context of interest and get acquainted with the design process.</p>

<p>The most widespread technologies (and solutions) that you may come across are web pages. <em>This advice may not apply if you have a hardware-based problem, but some of the advice may translate to mobile apps, wearables, or smart devices.</em> Below, I give you some concrete tips for improving existing web page solutions:
<strong>Helpful Advice for Improving Web Design:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/9-information-design-tips-to-make-you-a-better-web-designer--psd-1601">9 Information Design Tips to Make You a Better Web Designer</a></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> Use sketching as a tool to explore your designs. The goal here is to rapidly explore many different solutions with messy sketches, either by using pens/pencils/markers on paper or by sketching on whiteboards. After you have thoroughly explored the design space (you should have at least 5 ideas each for 3 different screens or aspects of the experience), use paper to construct a cleaner paper prototype.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your solution should have multiple screens or aspects to the experience. If you find that you’re stuck with only one or two, re-evaluate how you’re solving the problem. We need enough depth to ensure we’re solving the problem in a satisfying way for the users.</li>
  <li>5+ ideas for 3+ screens/aspects of the experience means <em>at minimum</em> there should be 15 sketches. Remember that it’s a sketch (so it should convey the idea without too much detail or effort).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Create a paper prototype (with options)</strong>: You should test this paper prototype with <strong>three</strong> other people in the class. Spend 15-20 minutes of making better versions of your favorite sketches that you will use for this testing. Your paper prototype should include at least one design option for the 3 screens. For example, if you have a home screen, an activity screen, and a workout recap screen on a fitness tracker, maybe you create a nicer sketch of two home screen options, two activity screen options, and one workout recap. You should make slightly nicer versions of these screen options so that your classmates fully understand the design. While your three classmates don’t necessarily represent your users (so this is typically bad practice), I want you to get in the habit of getting feedback on whatever you create. We’ll discuss user testing more in a week or two. Until then, do your best to get worthwhile feedback and write up what changes you would make to your prototype, based on this feedback.</p>

<p>When getting feedback from your classmates, ask if they have 5-10 minutes to evaluate your designs. At the start of the session, you should ask them if you can use their name in the write-up. After they say yes or no, then ask if you can take a picture of the evaluation session for your write-up. <em>If they say no to their name, refer to them as “a classmate” in your write-up. If they say no the picture, take a picture of the setting or of your sketches (or find a stock photo of prototype testing).</em></p>

<p><em>Fall 2025: Our classroom (Watson 247) is available after 3:30 PM on Monday and 4:00 PM on Tuesday. You are welcome to post on Slack to recruit classmates to meet up in 247 and test designs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Design a more complete evaluation plan.</strong> Assume time and resources were not a problem. How would you assess if your design accomplished the goals you set out to achieve? Write a few paragraphs describing how you might conduct an evaluation accordingly. Again, don’t fret too much on this part. We will learn more formal techniques in the coming weeks, so use this opportunity to be creative with your evaluation design – but be systematic!</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The output from this assignment should be the <a href="https://kawilliams.github.io/teaching/hci/design-doc">design document</a>. Submit the link of the Medium post along with your name on Moodle. As with all design documents, it should include evidence of your design process. <strong>You do NOT need to create a demo video for this design module.</strong> For this assignment, I would expect a minimum of the following:
    <ol>
      <li>description of the problem to be solved, including POV and HMW statements</li>
      <li>pictures of your various sketches</li>
      <li>a cleaned up paper prototype (more broadly, the evolution of your design should be clear – by reading your text and viewing the sketches, I should see how you ended up at this revised paper prototype)</li>
      <li>a description of how your designs were informed by the previous needfinding assignment</li>
      <li>a summary of the three evaluation sessions you conducted with classmates</li>
      <li>a description of how you would incorporate feedback from your classmates into future designs</li>
      <li>a description of a more complete evaluation plan (involving non-classmates) that you would conduct in the future</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
