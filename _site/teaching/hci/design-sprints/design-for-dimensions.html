<ul>
  <li>Group size: Teams of 3-4</li>
  <li>Design sprint starts: Wednesday, August 30, in class.</li>
  <li>Design sprint ends: Wednesday, September 13, in class (demo). Design document due at <em>11:55 PM</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Before you begin</strong>: Read this entire document and consider how you might want to split up work.</p>

<p>It’s time to begin the design process <em>as a team</em>. This first design spritn will build on the skills you developed
during the Health Design assignment and force you to engage with three aspects of the design process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Visual design</li>
  <li>Sketching for ideation (using paper)</li>
  <li>Prototyping tools (using <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="designing-for-dimensions">Designing for Dimensions</h2>
<p>In this design sprint, you will take an existing website and redesign it for <strong>three different devices</strong>. Dimensions, in this case, refers to different screen sizes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>a smart watch,</li>
  <li>a laptop, and</li>
  <li>a large multi-touch display (think <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-hub-3">Microsoft Surface Hub</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here’s the catch</strong>: you can’t just shrink or expand content to fit a different screen size. You must consider the holistic user experience of the device. The input modalities are different for a smart watch than a laptop. For instance, an Apple Watch has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZEgup5ijd4">digital crown</a>, while a laptop does not (note that the digital crown features have changed slightly). A large wall-sized multi-touch display is often used in collaborative settings, sometimes with pen and touch, while a laptop is usually for an individual.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you shouldn’t just translate the existing design for these devices. Instead, imagine that you want to create the best experience for a <em>specific user group</em>. Your group should define who that user group is. Who are they? What do they need (differently from other users), and how can you cater your design to that group? For instance, the informational needs, the designs you’d choose, and the interactions you might support would likely be very different if you were designing for people who live in Cornelius in their 50s v. Davidson College students.</p>

<!-- The website: you will be re-designing something near and dear to all our hearts. In the past, I have assigned websites for Atlanta-based businesses and organizations, including Emory Computer Science department website, Dave's Cosmic Subs in Emory Village, or Atlanta's Fox Theatre. This semester, you will choose the website of a local Atlanta business. Pick an organization or business that you and your groupmates care about, but don't spend too long deciding! -->
<p><strong>The website:</strong> you will be re-designing the <a href="https://www.knottyandboard.com/">Knotty and Board</a> website, a local home furnishings company.</p>

<p>While you will not redesign the entire website, you should redesign at least two pages on the website. One of those pages must be the homepage. The other/s must be accessible from the homepage.</p>
