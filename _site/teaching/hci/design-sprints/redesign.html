<ul>
  <li>Group size: Teams of 3-4</li>
  <li>Design sprint starts: Monday, November 4, in class. <em>Thanksgiving break is in this timeframe, don’t be misled by the due date.</em></li>
  <li>Design sprint ends: Monday, December 2 in class (demo). Design document due at <em>11:55 PM</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this design sprint, we will revisit one of the previous design sprints. <del>Which project we revisit will be determined by students voting in a survey. This page will be updated once the votes are in.</del> We will be revisiting <a href="/teaching/hci/design-sprints/understanding">Design Sprint #2: Design for Understanding</a>. This project will involve a few components and will involve several important in-class hack sessions.</p>

<h3 id="evaluate">Evaluate</h3>

<p>You should begin by evaluating your previous design. You will first need to decide what your evaluation criteria are: what is important to assess about your design (learnability, accessibility, utility…)? How can you operationalize the measurement of this criteria? Revisit our lecture resources for evaluation methodologies (cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, usability study, etc) and decide if one of these is fitting for your evaluation goals. A good framework for thinking about this can be found in <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/interactions-16.pdf">Research Contributions in Human-Computer Interaction</a> by Jacob Wobbrock and Julie Kientz.</p>

<p>Your evaluation likely involves human subjects. Feel free to reach out to friends and classmates or other potential users of your target audience. That means you should <em>make yourself available</em> to your classmates to participate in their evaluations. You will likely need them to participate in yours as well. Some of this can be achieved during our hack day. Some of it will likely need to take place outside of class.</p>

<p>By this point in the semester, your group should be able to make informed and carefully rationalized decisions about the task, target user group, number of participants, conditions, and other details of the experimental design. You will need to justify these choices in your blog posts.</p>

<p><strong>When in doubt, run your evaluation ideas by me.</strong></p>

<h3 id="iterate">Iterate</h3>

<p>Next, reflect deeply on your evaluation results. How can you use what you learned to inform the next iteration of your design? You will want to describe this reflection in your blog post and go on to implement these changes in your design. That means you will have a new prototype that reflects these design changes.</p>

<h3 id="extend">Extend</h3>

<p>In the final part of this project, you will be expanding on your previous design using a new prototying modality: physical prototyping. You can find some examples <a href="https://stephaniebaione.com/work/physical-prototyping">here</a>.</p>

<p>How you choose to extend your previous project can take many forms, entirely up to your group. Be sure to clearly state your goals. Depending on which project you are extending, some examples you might consider are re-designing a wearable biosensor to collect additional health data, an accessible <a href="http://yvonnejansen.me/dataphys">data physicalization</a> experience, a integrating tangible objects in a virtual reality art viewer, etc. You should show evidence of iteration in your physical prototying as well. Check out this <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/the-skeptics-guide-to-low-fidelity-prototyping/">article on low-fidelity prototyping</a> for guidance.</p>

<h4 id="for-design-sprint-2">For Design Sprint 2</h4>
<p>You should create at least 2 data physicalizations: one for the analysis and one for persuasion. I do <em>not</em> want you to literally recreate your existing visualizations. Instead, think about what aspects of your visualization would translate well to a physical medium and which ones might need to be changed. For example, any interactivity on a screen will need to be reimagined in physical space.</p>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<p>For this project, you will have access to tools and materials through <a href="https://www.davidson.edu/academic-departments/digital-studies/facilities">Studio M</a> (in room B260 in the south basement of Chambers, by Wall). Studio M has 3D printers, laser engravers, VR simulators, vinyl cutters, shirt presses, and various other tools. You also can access the <a href="https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/arts-creative-engagement/dace-studio">DACE Studio</a> (in the north basement of Chambers, by the flagpole). They have materials ranging from sewing machines, knitting machine, yarn and string, embroidery tools, paints, coloring utensils, paper, canvas, etc. You may also choose to use materials you find at home around the house (cardboard, plastic bottles, old tshirts, etc).</p>

<h3 id="re-evaluate">Re-evaluate</h3>

<p>Now, given your new physical prototype, your group should design and execute a preliminary evaluation of this extension. Refer back to slides on Experience Prototyping, Heuristic Evaluation, Usability Studies, etc. This evaluation will gather preliminary feedback, but it should include well-informed and justified experimental design decisions.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As always: Your group’s design reflection as a blog post on Medium. <strong>You WILL need a demo video.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>[If applicable] Your VR experience should be publicly accessible so that others can visit it. <strong>Include this link in your design doc.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Post the link of each blog post along with the names of your group members on our Slack channel for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#group-design-projects</code> <strong>and</strong> one group member should submit the link on Moodle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong> Grading will be based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aI9LcmVZmh_977G__U4Guz_rPRCwWZs26J_yHXbhSyY/edit?usp=sharing">design rubric</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to complete the peer feedback forms linked at the end of the <a href="/teaching/hci/design-doc">design document guide</a>, which will be a large part of your grade.</li>
</ul>
