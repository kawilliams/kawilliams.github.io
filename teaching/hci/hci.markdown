# About this course 

Human-computer interaction combines computer science, psychology, sociology, design, and art into one discipline. In this course, we will explore how to center the human experience in all kinds of computing, including designing for all humans (not just one kind of user). Though computers are relatively new, there is a rich history of the interactions between computers and humans, so I plan to delve into both the inspiring and inadvertently troubling. We will connect these historical lessons to practice, as students will engage in a deliberate design process as they create interfaces. This reflexive design approach will help students develop and apply humane instincts to the field of computer science.

# Policies

## Grading Philosophy
For many of you, most CS assignments that you’ve had up until this point had clear, crisply defined goals that mapped cleanly to point values. This is impossible in a course that relies on design. Simply checking off each of the TODOs on an assignment does not necessarily mean that you’ve created something that is easy and compelling to use.

**[Design Document Rubric](./design-doc.md)**: A majority of your assignments will use this rubric. Rather than simply ask “Did you do this?”, there will also be the question of “Did you do this *well*?”. This often translates to “Did you successfully apply the concepts we learned in class to this assignment?”. For example, if you build an app that is functional but breaks many design heuristics… that is **not** a successful application in this class.

**Peer Evaluation**: Many of the assignments that you complete will include some kind of peer evaluation. Usability isn’t a set of knowledge that one single person owns. Instead, software that is usable and works for one person may not for another. We will be critiquing each other’s work throughout the semester using the framing of *[I Like, I Wish, What If](https://www.thirdway.org/thinking-tool/i-like-i-wish-what-if)* from Stanford’s design school.

**Group Work**: Group work can be challenging. As a result, in each group project, you will submit a brief assessment of you and your classmates’ work. At the end of the semester, **I may use these assessments to reweight the group portion of your grade (either positively or negatively).**

**Timeliness**: All assignments are due at the start of class on the day listed in the schedule. You will have a total of 5 “free” late tokens to use for any homework assignments as needed throughout the course. Each token gets you a 24 hour extension on the assignment deadline. E.g., you can use 1 late token for HW1 and 1 for HW3, … These "free" tokens can apply *only to homework assignments and cannot be used for group projects*. These are for any cases where college-approved absences do *not* apply, and no reason must be given to use them. After the 5 “free” late tokens are used up, any late assignments will receive a 10% per day penalty. Assignments turned in one week or later past the due date will not be graded and given a 0. You do not need to notify Dr. Williams to use late tokens -- they will be automatically applied. Once you use them, you cannot switch them later in the course, so plan wisely. Any unused late tokens at the end of the semester will be added as 5% extra credit per unused token on the lowest homework assignment.

**Regrade Policy**: You can request a re-grade of an assignment within seven days of releasing the grade by sending an email to Dr. Williams. The request should contain a written explanation of why you think that the grade is incorrect. I will look over your work again upon request.

If there is an error in my original evaluation, I will correct it. However, do not ask for a regrade or a boost simply because you do not like your grade. If your request is based on a rationale of "what's the harm" or "it's worth a try," save your (and my) energy. Baseless requests for regrades devalue all of your classmates' hard work and waste everyone's time.

**Academic Honesty**: The spirit of the Honor Code that each student pledges upon entering their first year helps engender an atmosphere of trust. Every signature helps sustain a climate of freedom and integrity. Upholding the Honor Code secures the commitment to academic honesty and social responsibility that characterizes a Davidson education. 

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you are expected to complete assignments on your own. It is appropriate to discuss your ideas with others to gain feedback and help with sticky problems. It is not appropriate to find an existing solution online or from your friends, modify them, and submit as your own work. If in doubt, confer with Dr. Williams. It is much easier to ask about these things than handle the consequences of a poor decision.

**Accessibility Services**:
The college welcomes requests for accommodations related to disability and will 
grant those that are determined to be reasonable and maintain the integrity of 
a program or curriculum. To make such a request or to begin a conversation about
a possible request, please contact the Office of Academic Access and Disability 
Resources (AADR) by emailing AADR@davidson.edu. It is best to submit accommodation 
requests within the drop/add period; however, requests can be made at any time 
in the semester. Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive.

**Additional Resources for Students**:
Academic Access and Disability Resources (AADR) offers free academic coaching services
to students. If you need help with time management, test taking, studying 
efficiently, or other academic strategies, a professional staff academic coach 
or peer academic coach can meet with you once or on an as needed basis. Contact 
AADR@davidson.edu for more information. Please also stay tuned for Peer Academic 
Coaching events throughout the semester.

**Statement on Diversity and Inclusivity**
*Adapted from Lynn Hernandez, Behavioral and Social Sciences, School of Public Health, Brown University.*

I intend to serve students from diverse backgrounds and 
perspectives equally in this course and to meet your learning needs both inside
and outside of class. I view the diversity that you bring to this class as a 
resource, strength and benefit. I will continually strive to present materials 
and activities that are respectful of diversity along a multitude of axes: 
gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, political 
affiliation, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. I value 
your suggestions, and encourage you to share with me any ideas you may have to 
help me improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other
students or student groups.

It is my goal to foster an environment in which each class member is able to 
hear and respect others. If something is said or done by a member of the 
instructional team or a classmate that is particularly troubling, or causes 
discomfort or offense, I urge you to consider one of the following courses of 
action:

* Discuss the situation privately with one or more of the instructors. 
I am always open to listening to students' experiences, and want to work 
with you to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue. All such 
conversations will be kept confidential.
* *Discuss the situation with your classmates --- chances are there is at 
least one other student in the class who had a similar response. You may then 
choose to approach one or more of the instructors as a group, to voice your 
concerns, if that is a more comfortable setting.
* Complete the \hyperlink{https://forms.gle/fdknpkcVFcNRWoDZ8}{anonymous feedback form} that is linked to from Moodle, to 
bring the incident to our attention.
* Notify us of the issue through another source such as your academic 
advisor, a trusted faculty member, or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel
comfortable discussing the issue directly with one of us, I encourage you to 
seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue, such as the 
Student Counseling Center or via the Office of the Dean of Students.
