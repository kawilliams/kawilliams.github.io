# [Syllabus](./hci-syllabus)

# About this course 
The field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) encompasses the design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive computing systems. This course will provide a survey of HCI theory and will provide web-based implementation practice of these theories. The course will address the presentation of information and the design of interaction from a practical, human-centered perspective. Through a combination of technical topics in interface and interaction design, students will explore the capabilities and limits of both humans and computers.

Human-computer interaction combines computer science, psychology, sociology, design, and art into one discipline. In this course, we will explore how to center the human experience in all kinds of computing, including designing for all humans (not just one kind of user). Though computers are relatively new, there is a rich history of the interactions between computers and humans, so I plan to delve into both the inspiring and inadvertently troubling. We will connect these historical lessons to practice, as students will engage in a deliberate design process as they create interfaces. This reflexive design approach will help students develop and apply humane instincts to the field of computer science.

# Learning Objectives

## Design
Students should be able to describe and execute the steps of a user-centered design process

## Prototyping
Students should develop working proficiency in rapid prototyping with a variety of technologies (e.g., paper prototyping, Figma, Vega, Google Cardboard, etc.)

## Research Methods
Students should be able to describe and execute quantitative research methods.
Students should be able to describe and execute qualitative research methods.
Students should be able to design and justify a range of evaluation plans for an artifact.

## Engagement
Students should engage in discussions and activities in-class and online.

# Assignments & Responsibilities
You will be individually responsible for some homework assignments, participation and critique, oral exams, and your final project. In addition, there will be 4 design sprints throughout the semester, completed as gropu projects.
