# About this course 

Human-computer interaction combines computer science, psychology, sociology, design, and art into one discipline. In this course, we will explore how to center the human experience in all kinds of computing, including designing for all humans (not just one kind of user). Though computers are relatively new, there is a rich history of the interactions between computers and humans, so I plan to delve into both the inspiring and inadvertently troubling. We will connect these historical lessons to practice, as students will engage in a deliberate design process as they create interfaces. This reflexive design approach will help students develop and apply humane instincts to the field of computer science.

# Policies

## Attendance and Tardiness Policy
We will build a community of respect in this class. Part of respecting is others is valuing their time. I show respect to my students by promptly responding to emails and Slack messages sent between 8 AM and 5 PM. I show respect to my family and friends by ignoring work-related emails and messages between 5 PM and 8 AM.

Arriving late to class is disrespectful to your classmates, to me, and to the learning environment. **Arriving later than 10 minutes after the start of class (8:15 AM or later) will result in an unexcused
absence on your record.** Per college policy, a student who misses 25% or more of class meetings automatically fails the course. For a two-meeting-per-week course, this is missing 7 classes or more. 
should there be a conflict between any class session and a religious holiday or observance, students should let the instructor know of their personal need. Religious observance warrants a legitimately excused absence. Missing class due to athletic competition is not an excused absence and does count against your total absences.

## Accommodations for Attendance and Tardiness
I *highly* value communication around absences and tardiness. If you know you are going to be later than 10 minutes, message me on Slack at least 1 hour before class begins. Likewise, if you communicate early
and remind me about an upcoming absence, I am *more likely* to be flexible with deadlines around that absence date. Note: this is not a guarantee -- sometimes there are college policies that we all have to abide by. 

**There is no flexibility on the 25% attendance policy -- missing 7 classes or more is an automatic F in the course.** I take attendance each class period and will email warnings to any students with 4 or more absences reiterating this policy.

## Grading Philosophy
For many of you, most CS assignments that you’ve had up until this point had clear, crisply defined goals that mapped cleanly to point values. This is impossible in a course that relies on design. Simply checking off each of the TODOs on an assignment does not necessarily mean that you’ve created something that is easy and compelling to use.

**[Design Document Rubric](./design-doc.md)**: A majority of your assignments will use this rubric. Rather than simply ask “Did you do this?”, there will also be the question of “Did you do this *well*?”. This often translates to “Did you successfully apply the concepts we learned in class to this assignment?”. For example, if you build an app that is functional but breaks many design heuristics… that is **not** a successful application in this class.

**Peer Evaluation**: Many of the assignments that you complete will include some kind of peer evaluation. Usability isn’t a set of knowledge that one single person owns. Instead, software that is usable and works for one person may not for another. We will be critiquing each other’s work throughout the semester using the framing of *[I Like, I Wish, What If](https://www.thirdway.org/thinking-tool/i-like-i-wish-what-if)* from Stanford’s design school.

**Group Work**: Group work can be challenging. As a result, in each group project, you will submit a brief assessment of you and your classmates’ work. At the end of the semester, **I may use these assessments to reweight the group portion of your grade (either positively or negatively).**

**Due Date Timeliness**: All assignments are due at the start of class on the day listed in the schedule unless otherwise specified. You will have a total of 5 “free” late tokens to use for any homework assignments as needed throughout the course. Each token gets you a 24 hour extension on the assignment deadline. E.g., you can use 1 late token for HW1 and 1 for HW3, … You may use multiple tokens on one assignment, e.g. 2 tokens on HW1 for a 48 hour extension. These "free" tokens can apply *only to homework assignments and cannot be used for group projects*. These are for any cases where college-approved absences do *not* apply, and no reason must be given to use them. After the 5 “free” late tokens are used up, any late assignments will receive a 10% per day penalty. Assignments turned in one week or later past the due date will not be graded and given a 0. You do not need to notify Dr. Williams to use late tokens -- they will be automatically applied. Once you use them, you cannot switch them later in the course, so plan wisely. Any unused late tokens at the end of the semester will be added as 5% extra credit per unused token on the lowest homework assignment.

**Regrade Policy**: You can request a re-grade of an assignment within seven days of releasing the grade by sending an email to Dr. Williams. The request should contain a written explanation of why you think that the grade is incorrect. I will look over your work again upon request.

If there is an error in my original evaluation, I will correct it. However, do not ask for a regrade or a boost simply because you do not like your grade. If your request is based on a rationale of "what's the harm" or "it's worth a try," save your (and my) energy. Baseless requests for regrades devalue all of your classmates' hard work and waste everyone's time.

## Academic honesty and AI

### Academic Honesty
 The spirit of the Honor Code that each student pledges upon entering their first year helps engender an atmosphere of trust. Every signature helps sustain a climate of freedom and integrity. Upholding the Honor Code secures the commitment to academic honesty and social responsibility that characterizes a Davidson education. 

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you are expected to complete assignments on your own. It is appropriate to discuss your ideas with others to gain feedback and help with sticky problems. It is not appropriate to find an existing solution online or from your friends, modify them, and submit as your own work. If in doubt, confer with Dr. Williams. It is much easier to ask about these things than handle the consequences of a poor decision.

### AI Policy
**Background**: Generative AI tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—are widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for text and DALL•E and Midjourney for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our term together and those provided by the college (i.e. Amplify Gen AI and Gemini).

**AI statement**: The purpose of this class is to learn how to articulate your ideas throughout the design process, while developing a breadth of technical skills for prototyping. The valuable **human** skill that you will gain in this class is the ability to think creatively throughout the design process and to write and articulate the decisions you made. 

**You may use generative AI tools in this course from time to time**. In fact, some assignments will strongly encourage use of such tools. Your college-provided accounts on Amplify (amplify.davidson.edu) and Gemini (gemini.com) will be more than sufficient for these assignments. *You may choose not to use AI tools -- this is perfectly acceptable*.

If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves.
Please cite the tool according to the guidelines for citing computer software, as outlined in the [ACM style guide](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions).

If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out-of-date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations.

Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content.
It is your responsibility—not the tool’s—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course.

To that end, here is an incomplete list of acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI in my class. *If you have a question on whether a specific use of AI is allowed or not, you must message me on Slack and ask **before** you use AI.* Any unauthorized use of AI will be considered violations of academic integrity and will be brought before the Honor Council. Please maintain integrity, for your learning, your personal character, and academic record.

**Allowed uses of AI**
* To proofread your writing; to check grammar, rigor, and style (such as using Grammarly); to find alternative wording.
* To generate boilerplate code; to debug error messages. You will learn a wide variety of tools in a short amount of time -- I don't expect you to become an expert on your own. You may use generative AI to assist with coding and to get you 80% of the way there on assignments. You *will* need to revise this code, since AI will produce buggy or inefficient code.
* To verbally read the full contents of articles (so you listen to the original text, rather than read it); to *summarize* articles for *your own understanding* (not for a grade) *after* you have already read the original text. 
* To study for the Oral Exam by prompting Gemini/Amplify/etc. to ask you interview questions about the material. I have had students use this and they audibly (out loud) rehearsed their answers in their dorm room. These students did well on the Oral Exam, not because of the AI, but because they practiced speaking their answers.

**You may NOT use AI:**
* To generate outlines for blog posts. The [Design Doc](/teaching/hci/design-doc) serves as your starting point for blog posts and we will read plenty of examples of great blog posts. I expect the content of your writing, from outline to final product, to be solely written by you (see acceptable uses in proofreading above).
* To summarize a text or video without you reading or watching the original. The authors and creators of these works have used deliberate language and have carefully crafted their position. You will likely receive an incorrect or incomplete summary if you rely only on AI summaries. 
* To answer questions during Kahoot sessions or to generate answers during the Oral Exam.


## Accessibility, Inclusion, and Resources for Students
**Accessibility Services**:
The college welcomes requests for accommodations related to disability and will 
grant those that are determined to be reasonable and maintain the integrity of 
a program or curriculum. To make such a request or to begin a conversation about
a possible request, please contact the Office of Academic Access and Disability 
Resources (AADR) by emailing AADR@davidson.edu. It is best to submit accommodation 
requests within the drop/add period; however, requests can be made at any time 
in the semester. Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive.

**Additional Resources for Students**:
Academic Access and Disability Resources (AADR) offers free academic coaching services
to students. If you need help with time management, test taking, studying 
efficiently, or other academic strategies, a professional staff academic coach 
or peer academic coach can meet with you once or on an as needed basis. Contact 
AADR@davidson.edu for more information. Please also stay tuned for Peer Academic 
Coaching events throughout the semester.

**Specific Course Resources and Support**
We do not have a designated tutor for this class, but there are several services to help 
with writing support, data cleaning, and web development/GitHub support.

*Reading*: For assistance with text comprehension and reading recommendations, book an appointment 
with a peer tutor on Moodle: [https://lib.davidson.edu/Reading](https://lib.davidson.edu/Reading).

*Writing*: For assistance with all stages of wrigin, book an appointment with a peer tutor on Moodle: [https://lib.davidson.edu/Writing](https://lib.davidson.edu/Writing).

*Tech Support:* Data CATS are students who can help with data cleaning, website creation, and GitHub questions. Their primary role is data cleaning, but a few of the Data CATS staff have prior experience with website building and GitHub. Students who I personally know have expertise in these areas (since they're prior students or researchers): Kerem Atas, Patrick Grimes, Yurdanur Yolcu, Jack Schwanewede. Other Data CATS staff who may be able to help: Jordan Whitehouse (hi, Jordan!), Hakan Bora Yavuzkara, Mohamed Mostafa. **Data CATS are available in Chambers 3146 from Sunday through Thursday, with an afternoon shift from 2pm to 4pm, and an evening shift from 7pm to 9pm.**

**Statement on Diversity and Inclusivity**
*Adapted from Lynn Hernandez, Behavioral and Social Sciences, School of Public Health, Brown University.*

I intend to serve students from diverse backgrounds and 
perspectives equally in this course and to meet your learning needs both inside
and outside of class. I view the diversity that you bring to this class as a 
resource, strength and benefit. I will continually strive to present materials 
and activities that are respectful of diversity along a multitude of axes: 
gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, political 
affiliation, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. I value 
your suggestions, and encourage you to share with me any ideas you may have to 
help me improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other
students or student groups.

It is my goal to foster an environment in which each class member is able to 
hear and respect others. If something is said or done by a member of the 
instructional team or a classmate that is particularly troubling, or causes 
discomfort or offense, I urge you to consider one of the following courses of 
action:

* Discuss the situation privately with one or more of the instructors. 
I am always open to listening to students' experiences, and want to work 
with you to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue. All such 
conversations will be kept confidential.
* Discuss the situation with your classmates --- chances are there is at 
least one other student in the class who had a similar response. You may then 
choose to approach one or more of the instructors as a group, to voice your 
concerns, if that is a more comfortable setting.
* Notify us of the issue through another source such as your academic 
advisor, a trusted faculty member, or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel
comfortable discussing the issue directly with one of us, I encourage you to 
seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue, such as the 
Student Counseling Center or via the Office of the Dean of Students.
