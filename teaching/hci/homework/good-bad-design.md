# Good Design, Bad Design

* Group size: Individual
* Assignment opens: Wedneseday, August 27
* Due: Monday, September 1 *before class (8:00 AM)*
* **Estimated Time Spent**: 45 - 90 minutes
* Before you start this assignment, make sure that you have already read [Learning to See](https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see).

## Overview 
In this assignment, your objective is pretty straightforward: start training yourself to think about the design of things around you. Think carefully about how people interact with the physical or digital world. 
Is it good? Is it bad?

Sometimes these things are obvious, but other times, it turns out that weâ€™ve adapted our behavior to bad design. For us, clumsy becomes normal. So take the time to look at interactions with a new eye. Are they really good? Are they actually easy to use?

## Assignment
Find 1 example of *good* design and 1 example of *bad* design from your favorite website or in your daily life. Take pictures or screenshots.

Create a new slide in this [shared slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kZhXNRjuMT0WsQ6oblfWVs_8q5VWK5JlACggnB8K9IQ/edit?usp=sharing) where you show your pictures or screenshots and explain what makes it good (or bad). Think about who uses this design, when they are using it, and why they are using it.


## Deliverables
1. Add your good and bad design using this slide deck. You will add one slide for your submission.
2. Submit a PDF of the *current status* of the slide deck to Moodle for assignment "HW 1: Good/Bad Design". This PDF should include *your* slide and a few other students, but may not include the entire class' submissions when you submit. 

### Grading
Grading will be based on [this *variation*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fhxPxIEJWW42irDEAzylH0F2QHDg6NQIgFufRAigDFQ/edit?usp=sharing) of the [design rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aI9LcmVZmh_977G__U4Guz_rPRCwWZs26J_yHXbhSyY/edit?usp=sharing).
