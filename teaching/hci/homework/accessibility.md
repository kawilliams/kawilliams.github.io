# Design for Accessibility

* Group size: **Individual**
* Released: Monday, October 7
* Due: Wednesday, October 16 by 11:55 PM to Moodle

## Overview 
What [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GBLqZDXB_0) about a sidewalk accessibility project.

For 24 hours, walk around town/campus only using handicap accessible pathways. No stairs inside (not even tiny steps). No hopping onto curves outside. Use only paved paths and sidewalks. 

Create an annotated map (sketching, or using any digital tools you like) with the following information:
* At least 2-3 accessible "options." This can be an entrance to a building, good crosswalk location, powered 
doors, etc.
* At least 2-3 problematic areas that you found. For example, you can't enter the front of Chambers because of steps.
For each problem, create a marker with an appropriate symbol (include an image and a text description).


## Deliverables
1. As always: Your reflections as a Medium blog post. **You do not need a demo video.** Include your annotated map as well as reflections on the accessible and inaccessible examples you found. Be sure to reflect on the differences in the accessible and inaccessible paths.

### Grading
Grading will be based on a *variation* of the [design rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aI9LcmVZmh_977G__U4Guz_rPRCwWZs26J_yHXbhSyY/edit?usp=sharing).
