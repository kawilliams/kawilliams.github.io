# Debate

* Group size: Teams of 2-3
* Due: Wednesday, August 30, in class.


## Overview 

The goal of this assignment is for you to build knowledge about research in [human-computer interaction](https://chi2024.acm.org/). In two teams of 2-3 people, you will be debating opposing viewpoints on a given topic. Importantly, **your argument should be supported by research!**


## Debate Structure

You should be approximately following the debate structure identified [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi6Im-Sb6Vw).

**Opening:**

* Affirmative (A1): Pro Position (3 minutes)
    * 2 minute break (team meeting)
    * Opposing: Rebuttal (2 minutes)
* Opposing (O1): Con Position (3 minutes)
    * 2 minute break (team meeting)
    * Affirmative: Rebuttal (2 minutes)

**Statements:**

* Opposing (O2): Statements (3 minutes)
    * 2 minute break (team meeting)
    * Affirmative: Rebuttal (2 minutes)
* Affirmative (A2): Statements (3 minutes)
    * 2 minute break (team meeting)
    * Opposing: Rebuttal (2 minutes)

**2 min break (team meeting)**

**Closing:**

* Affirmative (A3): Closing (3 minutes)
* Opposing (O3): Closing (3 minutes)

Total time is 36 minutes. The remaining class time will be used to determine a winner. The whole class gets to vote on the winner. I'll also try to get external CS professors to judge the debates.


## Debate How-Tos

There is a lot of material online on how to debate well. For this class, the focus is not to train you to become a better debater. **The only requirement is for you to use publications as evidence for your arguments!** Use publications that are not too obscure (i.e. please use reputable conferences or journals). If you’re not sure if a reference is too obscure, contact me. Be prepared! Think of the evidence/publications that your opposing team could use and prepare for those arguments! Work together as a team!

Unlike typical debates, you are welcome (and encouraged) to use slides.

The two teams should schedule a meeting with me to go over the spirit of the debate. I will suggest possible papers or directions to pursue and answer any questions you might have. This should happen at least 1 week before the debate. You should have some ideas of the 3 key papers that you will use for your arguments.


## Debate Topics

There are four possible debate topics to explore.

1. **“Design guidelines considered harmful”**: HCI research has always had a strong aesthetic design component. As a result, a number of design guidelines have emerged over the years.
    * Affirmative team: Design guidelines are necessary. They help practitioners know how to design effective user interfaces. They also serve as the foundation of HCI research.
    * Opposing team: Design guidelines are rigid and have caused a great deal of harm to the community. There is no “good” or “bad” design – designs are inherently contextual and task dependent.
2. **“The humans are dead”**: This is the debate about automation versus human-user control. Data exploration, data analysis, and decision-making have increasingly become automated. Is a human-user still necessary?
    * Affirmative team: Human users are always necessary. Skynet anyone?
    * Opposing team: Automation is inevitable. Get with the program and start praying to our robot overlords.
3. **“HCI is critically missing in critical domains”**: Some of the greatest advances of our society seem to rely on "old" technology -- think NASA. think medicine.
    * Affirmative team: The greatest advances history in space exploration and medicine use tried and true technologies for a reason -- we are at our best when we stick to the basics of a powerful command line interface.
    * Opposing team: Our society's greatest advances are not at odds with a positive user experience. On the contrary, lessons from HCI have and will continue to inform the future of technological advances in critical domains.
4. **"Human-What Interaction?”**: Computers are central to the name (and spirit) of HCI. But they seem to be disappearing. What does a future of HCI look like if computers as we know them disappear?
    * Affirmative team: Computers as we know them are disappearing. In their place are interactions with the environment, with computers embedded.
    * Opposing team: Other current issues in the field such as ethics and privacy will ensure that computers in their traditional form are and will remain the cornerstone of HCI.

## Grading

Here is how you will be graded: 

[10%] Selection and relevance of key papers
[15%] Opening
[15%] Statement
[25%] Rebuttal
[15%] Closing
[20%] Group Evaluation (did you contribute to your team?)
[+10%] To the winning team (which team presented the most convincing argument? -- based on Peer Evaluation)
