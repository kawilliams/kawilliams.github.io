# CSC 362 Syllabus 
The field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) encompasses the design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive computing systems. This course will provide a survey of HCI theory and will provide web-based implementation practice of these theories. The course will address the presentation of information and the design of interaction from a practical, human-centered perspective. Through a combination of technical topics in interface and interaction design, students will explore the capabilities and limits of both humans and computers.

Human-computer interaction combines computer science, psychology, sociology, design, and art into one discipline. In this course, we will explore how to center the human experience in all kinds of computing, including designing for all humans (not just one kind of user). Though computers are relatively new, there is a rich history of the interactions between computers and humans, so I plan to delve into both the inspiring and inadvertently troubling. We will connect these historical lessons to practice, as students will engage in a deliberate design process as they create interfaces. This reflexive design approach will help students develop and apply humane instincts to the field of computer science.

**Prerequisite: CSC 221**

*Major/Minor requirements*
* CSC -- satisfies the major and minor Applications elective requirement
* DIG -- satisifies the major and minor Production, Methodology, Practice Courses elective requirement.

## Learning Outcomes
- Students will discuss why human-centered software development is important
- Students will summarize the basic precepts of psychology and social interaction
- Students will develop and use a conceptual vocabulary for analyzing human interaction with software: affordance, conceptual model, feedback, and so forth
- Students will define a user-centered design process that explicitly takes into account of the the needs of users with different identities than the developer or their acquaintances
- Students will create and conduct a simple usability test for an existing software application
- Students will collaboratively create a simple application with help and documentation that supports a graphical user interface.
- Students will conduct a quantitative evaluation and discuss/report the results

## Evaluation (course breakdown)
Scheduled Research Reflections (blog posts) – 20%
Individual assignments based on weekly content – 25%
Group projects (3 students) that explore the design space of a technical modality – 40%
A final design manifesto and portfolio at the end of the semester – 10%
Engagement with class visitors and trips – 5%


In addition to 3 hours in class, students will spend 2 hours per week reading papers and writing response blog posts. Approximately 4 hours per week will be spent working on group projects. Individual assignments will be started in class but will require 2 hours of out-of-class work to be completed. Maintaining a personal design portfolio will require 1 hour of work per week. During the finals period, students will be responsible for completing their final group project (4-6 hours), polishing their design portfolio website (2 hours) and writing a design manifesto that reflects the principles they have learned as well as their personal values (2 hours).
