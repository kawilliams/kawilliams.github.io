# About
Welcome to CSC 362: Data Visualization. This course is designed to provide you with the skills to effectively visualize and communicate about data. Visualization inherently contains a visual component and thus we will discuss how humans perceive images and how we should best leverage the skills (and limitations) of our perceptual system. 

### Prerequisites
Students in this class should already have taken CSC 221 Data Structures. **This is a non-negotiable pre-requisite.**
