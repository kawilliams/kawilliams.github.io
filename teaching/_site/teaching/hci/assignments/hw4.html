<h1 id="design-for-accessibility">Design for Accessibility</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Group size: <strong>Individual</strong></li>
  <li>Due: Wednesday, October 16</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>What <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GBLqZDXB_0">this video</a> about a sidewalk accessibility project.</p>

<p>For 24 hours, walk around town/campus only using handicap accessible pathways. No stairs inside (not even tiny steps). No hopping onto curves outside. Use only paved paths and sidewalks.</p>

<p>Create an annotated map (sketching, or using any digital tools you like) with the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least 2-3 accessible “options.” This can be an entrance to a building, good crosswalk location, powered 
doors, etc.</li>
  <li>At least 2-3 problematic areas that you found. For example, you can’t enter the front of Chambers because of steps.
For each problem, create a marker with an appropriate symbol (include an image and a text description).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
  <li>As always: Your reflections as a Medium blog post. <strong>You do not need a demo video.</strong> Include your annotated map as well as reflections on the accessible and inaccessible examples you found. Be sure to reflect on the differences in the accessible and inaccessible paths.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Grading will be based on a <em>variation</em> of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aI9LcmVZmh_977G__U4Guz_rPRCwWZs26J_yHXbhSyY/edit?usp=sharing">design rubric</a>.</p>
