<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment, your objective is pretty straightforward: start training yourself to think about the design of things around you. Think carefully about how people interact with the physical or digital world. 
Is it good? Is it bad?</p>

<p>Sometimes these things are obvious, but other times, it turns out that weâ€™ve adapted our behavior to bad design. For us, clumsy becomes normal. So take the time to look at interactions with a new eye. Are they really good? Are they actually easy to use?</p>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>Find 1 example of <em>good</em> design and 1 example of <em>bad</em> design from your favorite website or in your daily life. Take pictures or screenshots.</p>

Think about who uses this design, when they are using it, and why they are using it.</p>
