<h1 id="debate">Debate</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Group size: Teams of 2-3</li>
  <li>Due: Wednesday, August 30, in class.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is for you to build knowledge about research in <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/">human-computer interaction</a>. In two teams of 2-3 people, you will be debating opposing viewpoints on a given topic. Importantly, <strong>your argument should be supported by research!</strong></p>

<h2 id="debate-structure">Debate Structure</h2>

<p>You should be approximately following the debate structure identified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi6Im-Sb6Vw">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Opening:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Affirmative (A1): Pro Position (3 minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>2 minute break (team meeting)</li>
      <li>Opposing: Rebuttal (2 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Opposing (O1): Con Position (3 minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>2 minute break (team meeting)</li>
      <li>Affirmative: Rebuttal (2 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Opposing (O2): Statements (3 minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>2 minute break (team meeting)</li>
      <li>Affirmative: Rebuttal (2 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Affirmative (A2): Statements (3 minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>2 minute break (team meeting)</li>
      <li>Opposing: Rebuttal (2 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2 min break (team meeting)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Closing:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Affirmative (A3): Closing (3 minutes)</li>
  <li>Opposing (O3): Closing (3 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Total time is 36 minutes. The remaining class time will be used to determine a winner. The whole class gets to vote on the winner. I’ll also try to get external CS professors to judge the debates.</p>

<h2 id="debate-how-tos">Debate How-Tos</h2>

<p>There is a lot of material online on how to debate well. For this class, the focus is not to train you to become a better debater. <strong>The only requirement is for you to use publications as evidence for your arguments!</strong> Use publications that are not too obscure (i.e. please use reputable conferences or journals). If you’re not sure if a reference is too obscure, contact me. Be prepared! Think of the evidence/publications that your opposing team could use and prepare for those arguments! Work together as a team!</p>

<p>Unlike typical debates, you are welcome (and encouraged) to use slides.</p>

<p>The two teams should schedule a meeting with me to go over the spirit of the debate. I will suggest possible papers or directions to pursue and answer any questions you might have. This should happen at least 1 week before the debate. You should have some ideas of the 3 key papers that you will use for your arguments.</p>

<h2 id="debate-topics">Debate Topics</h2>

<p>There are four possible debate topics to explore.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>“Design guidelines considered harmful”</strong>: HCI research has always had a strong aesthetic design component. As a result, a number of design guidelines have emerged over the years.
    <ul>
      <li>Affirmative team: Design guidelines are necessary. They help practitioners know how to design effective user interfaces. They also serve as the foundation of HCI research.</li>
      <li>Opposing team: Design guidelines are rigid and have caused a great deal of harm to the community. There is no “good” or “bad” design – designs are inherently contextual and task dependent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>“The humans are dead”</strong>: This is the debate about automation versus human-user control. Data exploration, data analysis, and decision-making have increasingly become automated. Is a human-user still necessary?
    <ul>
      <li>Affirmative team: Human users are always necessary. Skynet anyone?</li>
      <li>Opposing team: Automation is inevitable. Get with the program and start praying to our robot overlords.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>“HCI is critically missing in critical domains”</strong>: Some of the greatest advances of our society seem to rely on “old” technology – think NASA. think medicine.
    <ul>
      <li>Affirmative team: The greatest advances history in space exploration and medicine use tried and true technologies for a reason – we are at our best when we stick to the basics of a powerful command line interface.</li>
      <li>Opposing team: Our society’s greatest advances are not at odds with a positive user experience. On the contrary, lessons from HCI have and will continue to inform the future of technological advances in critical domains.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>“Human-What Interaction?”</strong>: Computers are central to the name (and spirit) of HCI. But they seem to be disappearing. What does a future of HCI look like if computers as we know them disappear?
    <ul>
      <li>Affirmative team: Computers as we know them are disappearing. In their place are interactions with the environment, with computers embedded.</li>
      <li>Opposing team: Other current issues in the field such as ethics and privacy will ensure that computers in their traditional form are and will remain the cornerstone of HCI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Here is how you will be graded:</p>

<p>[10%] Selection and relevance of key papers
[15%] Opening
[15%] Statement
[25%] Rebuttal
[15%] Closing
[20%] Group Evaluation (did you contribute to your team?)
[+10%] To the winning team (which team presented the most convincing argument? – based on Peer Evaluation)</p>
